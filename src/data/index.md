### Welcome!

I'm KarbonKitty, and you have found my Deck of Many Things - central page that is a hub for my projects, at least those ready for the public eye. There are two sections with links on the right: first contains the stuff you can use or play, and the second is the stuff you can read.

As the time passes, I will be trying to get my ramblings somewhat more organized with some kind of categories or tags, but for now, there will be anything I've written, in chronological order (so new stuff on top).

If you are interested in contacting me, for the time being, you can do so on Reddit (I'm KarbonKitty there, too).
