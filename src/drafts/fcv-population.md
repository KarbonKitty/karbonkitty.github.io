# Population of the Free City

Total population of Free City Vratislavia is about 30 million people. The exact number is difficult to determine - while anybody living in Vratislavia can get a certificate of citizenship, there is only limited amount of effort from the city to count all it's citizens up, and the censuses are only conducted once every 20 years. The last census took place in 2020, and the next is scheduled for 2040.

Population growth of Free City is attributed to immigration, and it has been since Vratislavia has gained it's status as a separate state. As of 2037, the number of children born per woman in FCV was estimated at 1.3, one of the lowest coefficients in the world, and on par with Singapore. This leads to very diversified population structure, with immigrants from various parts of the world coming to the city, especially during times of economic trouble in their homelands.

Three biggest population groups are Poles, Germans and Czechs, as those are the countries that once rules over Vratislavia. Poles are the biggest group, followed by Germans, and then Czechs. People from those countries immigrated to Vratislavia right from the beginning of the Free City's history. Among the oldes groups there are also Russians, since the Soviet defeat in 1947 allowed them to escape economical wasteland their country became after decades of Communist rule.
